\section{Introduction and motivation}
\paragraph{Proton-radius puzzle}
The previously conducted measurements \cite{spectroscopy}, \cite{lambshift} of the $2S - 2P$ energy splitting in muonic hydrogen ($\mu{p}$) from the triplet ($2S_{\nicefrac{1}{2}}^{F=1} - 2P_{\nicefrac{3}{2}}^{F=2}$) and the singlet ($2S_{\nicefrac{1}{2}}^{F=0} - 2P_{\nicefrac{3}{2}}^{F=1}$) $2S$ sub-levels have shown a $7{\sigma}$ discrepancy comparing to the values extracted from the electron-proton scattering and hydrogen ($H$) spectroscopy. This so-called ``proton-radius puzzle" is interesting for different areas of physics research: verifications of the proton structure at low energies, new determinations of the Rydberg constant, and searches of BSM physics. Moreover, it has triggered various reanalysis of electron-proton scattering data and several new experiments in the field of scattering and atomic physics. So far, the resolution of the ``proton-radius puzzle'' remains unknown.

\paragraph{Hyperfine splitting}
The Hyperfine splitting (HFS) is the magnetic moment - magnetic moment interaction. This can be described \cite{proposal} as
\begin{equation}
\Delta{E}^{HFS}_{theor} = E^F(1 + {\Delta}_{QED} + {\Delta}_{TPE} + {\Delta}_{weak + HVP}),
\end{equation}
with $E^F$ denoting the Fermi energy,
\begin{equation}
E^F = \frac{8}{3}{\alpha}^4 \frac{{\mu}_p{m_1^2}{m_2^2}}{(m_1+m_2)^3},
\end{equation}
${\Delta}_{TPE}$, the two-photon exchange (TPE) contribution (Fig. \ref{fig:tpediagram}), $\alpha$, the fine-structure constant, ${\mu}_p$, the proton magnetic moment, $m_1$, the muon mass, and $m_2$, the proton mass. ${\Delta}_{QED}$ represents the QED contribution, ${\Delta}_{weak+HVP}$ denotes the contribution of hadronic vacuum polarisation (HVP), ${\Delta}_{str}$ is the correction due to the proton structure, and ${\Delta}_{pol}$ is the correction due to the polarisability contribution \cite{martynenko}.
\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{img/tpediagramms}
\caption{TPE diagrams in forward kinematics: the horizontal lines correspond to the lepton and the nucleus (bold). (a) Elastic contribution to the TPE diagram. (b) Inelastic contribution to the TPE diagram, where the "blob" represents all possible excitations \cite{franziska}.}
\label{fig:tpediagram}
\end{figure} 

\paragraph{Two-photon exchange}
The TPE can be divided into $3$ terms,
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{TPE} = \Delta_{Z} + \Delta_{recoil} + \Delta_{pol},
\end{equation}
where the elastic contribution (Zemach) is given by
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{Z} = \frac{8Z{\alpha{m_r}}}{\pi} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{dQ}{Q^2} \Bigg( G_{E}(Q^2) \frac{G_M(Q^2)}{1+\kappa_p} - 1 \Bigg) = -2 (Z{\alpha}) m_r R_Z,
\end{equation}
with the Zemach radius defined as 
\begin{equation}
R_Z = - \frac{4}{\pi} \int_0^{\infty} \frac{dQ}{Q^2} \Bigg( G_E(Q^2) \frac{G_M(Q^2)}{1 + \kappa_p} - 1 \Bigg),
\end{equation}
where ${\kappa}_p$ is a term related to the dipole magnetic moment of the proton. The Zemach radius non-relativistically reduces to the convolution of charge $\rho_{E}$ and magnetic $\rho_{M}$ distributions
\begin{equation}
R_Z = \int d^3 \bm{r} |\bm{r}| \int d^3 \bm{r'} \rho_{E} (\bm{r} - \bm{r'}) \rho_{M} (\bm{r'}).
\end{equation}
This is the contribution with the largest uncertainty of the order of $1 \times 10^{-4}$ of the total HFS. The ${\Delta}_{pol}$ term is the polarisability contribution and the ${\Delta}_{recoil}$ is the negligible recoil correction to the Zemach term. There are two approaches to evaluate the polarisability contribution: using dispersion relations and data such as structure functions and form factors or using chiral perturbation theory. In the dispersive approach, the inelastic contribution can be fully calculated using the measured spin-dependent structure functions of the proton, $g_1(x,Q^2)$ and $g_2(x,Q^2)$ \cite{proposal}.

%Some possible BSM resolutions: breakdown of the perturbative approach in the electron-proton interaction at short distances, interaction with sea leptons, and unusual proton structure.

\paragraph{Motivation}
The measurement of the $1S-HFS$ transition in the $\mu{p}$ with $1$ ppm accuracy can be used to evaluate the TPE contribution with a relative accuracy of $1 \times 10^{-4}$. This would increase our understanding of the low-energy structure of the proton and would provide a benchmark for chiral perturbation theory, dispersion-based approaches, and lattice QCD. A new experiment (HyperMu) designed to contribute to the resolution of the ``proton-radius puzzle'' is being developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI). HyperMu is aiming to measure the ground-state hyperfine splitting ($1S - HFS$) in $\mu{p}$ (Fig. \ref{fig:sublevels}) with an accuracy of $1$ ppm by means of laser spectroscopy. From the successful measurement of the $1S-HFS$ transition, the nuclear-structure - related ${\Delta}_{TPE}$ contribution effects can be determined with a relative accuracy of $1 \times 10^{-4}$. In a second step from the TPE, the Zemach radius can be extracted to accuracies of about $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$ limited by the theoretical uncertainty of the polarisability contribution. Moreover, the measurement would also be a test of the lepton universality, i.e. when $\mu{p}$ laser spectroscopy results are compared to the electron-proton scattering and to the electronic hydrogen ($ep$) spectroscopy, and on top of that it would impact the resolution of the ``proton radius puzzle'' and the related ``new physics'' searches.

\section{Working principle}
\paragraph{The principle of the HyperMu experiment:}
Muons are stopped in hydrogen gas forming ${\mu}p$ atoms in highly-excited states. The formed ${\mu}p$ atoms de-excite to the $F=0$ sub-level of the ground state (Fig. \ref{fig:sublevels}). A high-energy laser pulse ($3$ mJ at $6.7 {\mu}m$ and $100$ MHz bandwidth) excites the ${\mu}p$ atoms to the $F=1$ sub-level of the ground state,
%\begin{enumerate}
%\item
%Formation: a muon is stopped in hydrogen gas forming a ${\mu}p$ atom in a highly excited state.
%\item
%De-excitation: the formed ${\mu}p$ atom de-excites to the $F=0$ sub-level of the ground state.
%\item
%Laser excitation: a high-energy laser pulse excites the ${\mu}p$ atom,
\begin{equation*}
{\mu}p_{F=0} + {\gamma} \rightarrow {\mu}p_{F=1}.
\end{equation*}
In collisions with hydrogen molecules ($H_2$), the $\mu{p}$ atoms are de-excited to the $F=0$ sub-level,
%\item
%Collisional de-excitation: in a collision with a hydrogen molecule ($H_2$), the ${\mu}p$ atom is de-excited to the $F=0$ sub-level of the ground state and after ${\sim}1$ ${\mu}s$ is thermalised to the hydrogen gas temperature ($50$ K),
\begin{equation*}
{\mu}p_{F=1} + H_2 \rightarrow {\mu}p_{F=0} + H_2 + E_{kin}.
\end{equation*}
This transition energy is converted into the kinetic energy. Having this extra kinetic energy, the ${\mu}p$ atoms efficiently diffuse to the target walls before muon decays occur. At the target wall, which is made of the high-Z material, the muons are transferred from the $\mu{p}$ to the high-Z material forming $({\mu}Z)^{*}$ in an excited state. The highly-excited $({\mu}Z)^{*}$ atoms then de-excite producing MeV X-rays. The MeV X-rays are detected using scintillating detectors (Fig. \ref{fig:targetscheme}). A resonance curve is obtained by plotting the number of the X-rays versus the laser frequency. 
%\item
%Diffusion: having this extra kinetic energy, the ${\mu}p$ atom efficiently diffuses to the target walls before muon decay occurs.
%\item
%At the wall: at the target wall, which is made of high-Z material, the muon is transferred from the muonic hydrogen to the high-Z material forming $({\mu}Z)^*$ in an excited state. The highly excited $({\mu}Z)^*$ atoms then de-excite producing MeV X-rays.
%\item
%Detection: the MeV X-rays are detected using scintillators. A resonance is obtained by plotting the number of X-rays versus the laser frequency.

\caption{HyperMu experimental scheme showing a laser cavity, muon entrance beam, and the surrounding scintillating detectors \cite{proposal}.}
\label{fig:targetscheme}
\end{figure}



\paragraph{Signal and background}\label{para:signature}
The signal events are considered to be the MeV X-rays detected within a time window ${\Delta}t$ after the laser excitation. There are two types of background events: intrinsic and erroneous. The intrinsic background is produced by non-laser excited ${\mu}p$ atoms, that diffuse to the target walls in the observation time window ${\Delta}t$. This type of background can be minimised by cooling down the target, e.g. keeping the $H_2$ gas at $50$ K temperature. The other type of background arises from the electrons produced in the event of a muon decay, ${\mu}^- \rightarrow e^- + \overline{{\nu}_e} + {\nu}_{\mu}$, and being falsely identified as X-rays. 
%\begin{itemize}
%\item
%Signal: MeV X-rays detected in a time window ${\Delta}t$ after the laser excitation.
%\item
%Intrinsic background: produced by non-laser excited ${\mu}p$ atoms, that diffuse to the target walls in the observation time window ${\Delta}t$. Cosmics.
%\item
%Other backgrounds: caused by electrons from muon decays falsely identified as X-rays.
%\end{itemize}
%It is bad if an electron is identified as an X-ray. We need to minimise this erroneous background to manage having enough statistics for the successful run of the experiment. 

\paragraph{Laser system}
To produce a resonance curve for the $1S - HFS$ transition in the $\mu{p}$, a high-energy laser system delivering $3$ mJ pulses with $100$ MHz bandwidth at $6.7$ ${\mu}m$ is needed. We are planning to realise a laser system as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:opopascheme}. It is composed of a thin-disk laser followed by optical-parametric down-conversion stages (OPO - OPA) and a difference frequency generating stage (DFG). Using this OPO and OPA scheme, the thin-disk laser needs to be operated in single-frequency mode achieved by injection seeding the thin-disk laser oscillator with an external frequency stabilised continuous-wave (cw) laser at $1030$ nm. The pulses at $1030$ nm would then be down-converted in a non-linear crystal to produce two beams, so called an ``idler'' beam at $2434$ nm and a ``signal'' beam at $1785$ nm. The OPO cavity needs to be seeded by a tunable ``signal'' laser used to scan the resonance. A successive difference frequency generation (DFG) between ``idler'' and ``signal'' pulses would then be used to generate $3$ mJ pulses at $6.7 {\mu}$m.

\end{figure}


\section{The detection system}
\paragraph{Requirements}
One of the main topics of this thesis is to develop the needed detection system for the HFS experiment. One possible scheme is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:setup}. The aims of the detection system are listed below.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
	Detection of the incoming muons. The detected signal is used to trigger the Data Acquisition (DAQ) and the laser systems. 
\item
	Measurement of the produced X-ray cascades in the $({\mu}Z)^*$ de-excitation process after the ${\mu}p$ atoms have diffused to the target wall.
\item
	Detection of the nuclear capture event. After de-excitation to the ground-state, the muons in the ${\mu}Z$ atoms are mainly captured in the nuclear process (${\mu}^- + p \rightarrow n + {\nu}_{\mu}$).
\item
	The detection system also needs to measure the electrons from regular muon decays. Those electrons are produced when the ${\mu}p$ atoms that do not reach the target wall decay. The nuclear capture rate in the ${\mu}p$ atom is much smaller than in high-$Z$ ${\mu}Z$ atoms. 
\item
	The detection system must also deal with the background coming from the beam-line and muons stopping in the entrance detector and target window.
\end{enumerate}
For simplicity, in this plan we will only describe the detection of electrons coming from the muon decays and X-rays coming from the muonic X-ray cascade (Table \ref{table:cascade}).
\begin{figure}[!htbp]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/setup2.png}
\caption{Sketch of the detection system. After the incoming muon beam hits the entrance detector (shown in blue), it enters the target area (brown) with the thoroidal cavity inside (grey). On both down-stream and up-stream parts, series of different thickness plastic scintillators are going to be used (yellow and blue) to detect the X-ray signal and to distinguish it from the background.}
\label{fig:setup}
\end{figure}


\paragraph{Material}
The ideal material for the detectors would be germanium (Ge) as it provides a good energy resolution. However, its detection rate is too low for HyperMu, therefore we need to use alternative materials that could fulfil the above-listed conditions. We are considering to use thin plastic scintillators to distinguish between a X-ray coming from the cascade event and an electron coming from the muon decay (Fig. \ref{fig:cascade}). Scintillators have a property that the energy spectrum of cascade events differs considerably from the energy spectrum of an electron from muon decay (Fig. \ref{fig:michel}). Therefore, a simple energy cut could be used to distinguish between $e^-$ and X-rays.

\paragraph{Combination of thin and thick scintillators}
Electrons and X-rays also can be distinguished by considering their total deposited energy. In fact, cascade events have energies up to $10$ MeV while the energies of the electrons from the muon decay are distributed according to Fig. \ref{fig:michel}. Thus, a second energy cut can be applied to the total energy. Therefore, a thicker scintillator that completely absorbs the X-rays and the electrons could be used. Fig. \ref{fig:separation} shows an energy spectrum produced with a $50$-mm plastic scintillator for the X-ray cascade and the electrons. These two general ideas are the basis of the detection system sketched in Fig. \ref{fig:setup}. An algorithm distinguishing them can be developed based on the facts that:
\begin{itemize}
\item[-]
	the cascade detection efficiency should be $\geq 50 \%$,
\item[-]
	the false identification of electrons as X-rays should be $< 5 \times 10^{-3}$.
\end{itemize}

%\begin{figure}[!htbp]

%\caption{Signal to background ratio.}
%\label{fig:sig2bkg}
%\end{figure}
The two criteria that can be implemented in the algorithm origin from the signal-to-background ratio. Consider Fig. \ref{fig:diffusion}, where $A_1$ marks the target area and the $A_2$ marks the laser-excited muon atoms (shown in blue and pink, respectively). Then the background, $B$, can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
B= d \frac{A_2}{A_1}  N_{stopped\: {\mu}^-} P_{\mu \rightarrow {e^-}\overline{{\nu}_e}{\nu}_{\mu}} \varepsilon_{det} = d \frac{A_2}{A_1} N_{stopped\: {\mu}^-}  \Big(1 - e^{-\frac{300ns}{2200ns}}\Big),
\end{equation}
where d is the target width, $A_2$ is the area of the stopped ${\mu}^-$ atoms, $P_{\mu \rightarrow {e^-}\overline{{\nu}_e}{\nu}_{\mu}}$ is the probability for a muon to decay and produce an electron, and $\varepsilon_{det}$ is the detection probability of such an event. The signal, $S$, on the other hand, can be expressed as
\begin{equation}
S = d' \frac{A_2}{A_1} N_{stopped\: {\mu}^-} P_{laser-excited} P_{laser-excited\: reach\: the\: wall} \varepsilon_{det}.
\end{equation}
Here, $d'$ is the width of the laser-excited region, $P_{laser-excited}$ is the probability that the atoms in the region get excited by the laser, $P_{laser-excited\: reach\: the\: wall}$ is the probability that those that had been laser-excited will reach the wall of the target. Now, if we calculate the signal-to-background ratio, some of the parameters cancel out:
\begin{equation}
\frac{S}{B} = \frac{d'}{d} \frac{{P_{laser-excited}}{P_{laser-excited\: reach\: the\: wall}}}{ \Big(1 - e^{-\frac{300ns}{2200ns}}\Big)} = \frac{d'}{d} \frac{P_{laser}}{\Big(1 - e^{-\frac{300ns}{2200ns}}\Big)},
\end{equation}
where $\frac{d'}{d}$ is the so-called overlap, $P_{laser}$ is a combined probability that the muonic atom will be laser excited and will reach the wall, and it is equal to $\sim 1 \%$. Thus, the ratio $\nicefrac{S}{B}$ is approximately $5 \times 10^{-3}$.

\section{Simulations}
\paragraph{Scintillation detectors}
Traversing the matter, particles lose energy while interacting with the material particles. The interaction mechanisms differ depending whether a particle is neutral or charged. Also, the amount of energy deposited in the material differs depending on the initial energy and the type of the interacting particle. Plastic scintillation detectors can be used to detect these interactions. When  excited by ionising radiation, scintillating materials absorb the energy of the incoming particle and re-emit the absorbed energy in the form of light. The generated pulses of light can then be detected by light-sensitive detectors, e.g. photomultiplier tubes (PMT).

\paragraph{Particle interaction with matter}
When traversing the light plastic scintillating material, electrons continuously lose $\sim 2 MeV/cm$. The deposited energy is then converted into the radiation, e.g. photons. This is caused by the bremsstrahlung process, which happens when a highly-energetic charged particle is being deflected in the electric field of an atomic nucleus. On the other hand, when the X-rays travel through the medium, they scatter off the charged particles producing the secondary X-rays and the electrons (the so-called Compton scattering). Those secondary X-rays can scatter off again generating cascades of the secondary particles. By varying the thickness of the scintillation detectors and the solid angle of their position, one can get a clue about the primary particle. 

\paragraph{Hyper\textcolor{red}{e}X}
The purpose of the detection system (Hyper\textcolor{red}{e}X) for the HyperMu experiment is to detect the MeV X-ray signal events and to reject the erroneous background events caused by the electrons coming from the muon decay (Sec. \ref{para:signature}). A system of scintillation detectors can be used to tackle this problem. Different detector geometries and materials are being considered using a Monte Carlo simulation package $G4beamline$ \cite{g4beam} to find an optimal design before its realisation. To judge, whether a geometry is suitable, we introduce the ratio $\nicefrac{P_{{e{\rightarrow}{X}}}}{P_{{e}\rightarrow{e}}}$, where $P_{e{\rightarrow}X}$ is the probability that an electron is misidentified as a X-ray and $P_{X{\rightarrow}X}$ is the X-ray detection efficiency. To accept the geometry as satisfactory, the aforementioned ratio should be larger than the marginal value of $5 \times 10^{-3}$ that comes from the signal to background ratio (SBR). Two detection schemes that look promising emerge using (1) a magnetic setup or (2) a planar geometry.

\paragraph{Cylindrical detector in a magnetic field}
One of the detection schemes is employing the usage of a homogeneous $5$ T magnetic field surrounding the target and the detection regions (Fig. \ref{fig:magnetic}). This would make charged particles spiral along the beam axis and would not allow them to deposit any energy in the hollow cylindrical detector surrounding the beam axis. Thus, the false-identification of the negatively charged electrons would be eliminated. Even though this scheme could provide us with a better beam intensity (due to a better beam focus) and a misidentification probability $P_{e{\rightarrow}X}$ at the required level of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-3})$, simulations have shown (Fig. \ref{fig:phishift}) that the X-ray detection efficiency $P_{X{\rightarrow}X}$ is well too low the needed $\sim 65 \%$ to make up an acceptable ratio $\nicefrac{P_{{e{\rightarrow}{X}}}}{P_{{e}\rightarrow{e}}}$. Other additional disadvantages would be the lack of space for the optical cavity, harder access to the detectors and the experimental mechanics, and finally, increased costs and duration for the magnet's production.

\paragraph{Detector with a planar geometry}
Another feasible detection scheme would consist of layers of parallelepiped-shaped scintillation detectors of varying thickness (Figs. \ref{fig:phishift} and \ref{fig:zshift}). Initial simulations have shown that a change in the transverse and/or lateral size of the scintillators reveals a different behaviour in the energy deposition for the signal and background particles. It was noticed, that the thicker the detector is, the more likely that a X-ray will deposit some energy in it. The wider it is, thus the bigger solid angle is covered, and the more hits of the particles that scatter off it detects. Moving the detectors away from the optical cavity, i.e. introducing a $z$-shift, and changing the diameter of the mechanics surrounding the target, i.e. introducing a $\phi$-shift, also shows some significant differences (Figures \ref{fig:planar}).

\caption{X-ray detection efficiency and electron misidentification as a X-ray probability plotted versus a lower energy threshold $E_{THR}$ applied to the scintillation detectors. This can be thought of as a benchmark to cut some of the background events in the low-energy region, $< E_{THR}$.}
\label{fig:misid}
\end{figure}

\paragraph{Further steps}
The next step is to introduce the missing physical processes into the simulation package, i.e. nuclear capture and muon transfer to gold. After re-optimisation of the already considered parameters and after reaching a high enough X-ray detection efficiency $P_{X{\rightarrow}X}$ and a low enough $P_{e{\rightarrow}X}$ probability in the simulations, a design will be established for the manufacture. One of the beam times will be used to test this design.
